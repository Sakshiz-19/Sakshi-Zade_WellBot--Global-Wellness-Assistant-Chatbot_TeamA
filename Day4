SDLC role:
1. Functional Consultant / Business Analyst → Translates business needs into clear technical requirements for the development team.
2. Developer / Programmer → Designs and writes code to build the software according to specifications.
3. Tester / QA Team → Ensures software quality by detecting bugs and verifying functionality through testing.
4. Administration Team → Manages system infrastructure, databases, and environments to support development and deployment.
5. Project / Product Manager → Oversees planning, execution, and delivery while balancing scope, time, and resources.
